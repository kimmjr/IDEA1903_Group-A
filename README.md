## How to interact with our artwork

We have separated our class / functions into their own .js files and created a main sketchNew.js file which calls each of these functions.

- Open artwork using sketchNew.js
- Our artwork is time based, so everything will automatically move as it is supposed to.
- You will notice the background circles morphing as the time passes.
- Each of the lines around the weaves draw, fade and then re-draw.
- The weaves have continuous movement, as do the worms.
